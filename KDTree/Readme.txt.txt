A KD Tree Algorithm with:

1. A KD Tree Constructor
2. An iterator
3. A method to find the nearest Date node to a point

P.S. You can see where the insturctor's code is, and my own code. 

A K-D Tree(also called as K-Dimensional Tree) is a binary search tree where data in each node is a 
K-Dimensional point in space. In short, it is a space partitioning(details below) data structure 
for organizing points in a K-Dimensional space
